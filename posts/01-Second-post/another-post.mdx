## Fresh out of bootcamp and still a long way to go...

So I am one month out of my coding bootcamp and after getting no coding done in August due
to personal reasons, I found myself needing to brush up on my vanilla JavaScript. One thing
I have realised since starting this journey is that there is simply not enough hours in a day,
or days in a week... or weeks in a year to learn everything that I want to when it comes to
development.

Just when you think you are getting somewhere... like building a HTML & CSS site that is responsive and actually not bad to look at, COOL! but, we
use frameworks to build modern sites now. Fine, I'll learn React.

Look I built this web app in React with State and Router, isn't that awesome!...yeah but it's all about
API's now...

and so on and so on and so on.....

To be honest, most of my experience of vanilla JavaScript has come through writing JSX. I don't know if that's a good or bad thing,
there are pro's and con's to everthing. One thing I know though is that a lot of companies hiring now are looking for pure programming
skills and that means solving problems with just good ol' vanilla JS.

## And so here I am ...

Trawling the internet for every JS resource there is. I guess it is not a stretch to say though, never has it been easier
to pick up a programming language than today. There is literally a mammoth amount of free and paid resources from beginner right
through to the hacking expert available.

## So what am I using to level-up?

I have found myself studying the fantastic resources created by Kyle Simpson (more commonly known as @getify online). He is the author
of books such as 'You don't know JavaScript' and 'Functional programming'. They are both honestly fantastic. I've actualy been through
'You don't know JS' probably 4 or 5 times now and continually learn from it. Recently, I've moved on to functional programming, after
a brief stint on FreeCodeCamp's functional programming section I found myself drowning, lost and feeling out of my depth. So I turned
to who I know knows this stuff best and that's Kyle. His functional programming book and video series with Frontend Masters is truly
great, it starts out with fairly mellow and by the end totally twisting any consumers mind, it's ok he reassures us, it happens to
everyone the first time they read code created with the principles of funtional programming. I loved it. I didn`t undsertand all of it,
but I did learn. I see its great potential and will contine to work making my own code aligned with functional programming principles.

## OK, Kyle is great but is there anyone else out there??

Yes!! Another person who I find a fantastic teacher is Bianca Gandolfo. I've followed quite a few of her courses now on JS and more advanced
algorithms and data structures. The latter I started studying to prepare for future interviews and found the material not only challenging
but very interesting. Bianca is also capable of creating really useful learning material in the form of exercises that are related
to her teaching material. As they say no better way to improve than actually writing the code yourself. And that's what I have enjoyed
most from both of these great teachers, the time they've taken to create challenging and stimulating learning experiences.
