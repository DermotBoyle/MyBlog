## Welcome :)

Hey !! Thanks for coming to visit my blog. I built it to gain experience using Gatsby and GraphQL.

Let me tell you about what I learnt in the process...

### What specific tech went into building this?

One of the things I've loved since starting my new career in web development is learning great new technologies. I learnt a ton
of things building this site like : MDX, Photo Optimization, GraphQL template queries, the GraphQL
playground, building template posts, styled components....and a lot of other things!

Also, I learnt to look at building websites in a totally new way concerning global accessibilty to the internet.

## How are people all over the world accessing our websites ?

Living in Madrid and having grown up in Ireland with fast internet speeds since the introduction of broadband; I've become accustomed (as most of us from
developed countries) to fast internet. 3G or even 2G are things of the distant past for so many of us, heck there are even developers
working now who probably never waited a day to download a song.... or a week for a terrible pirated movie....

Anyway to get to the point, there are still many people in the world today who do not have access to super fast internet. So when
I learnt about Gatsby's photo optimization, reducing a 3MB picture down to a few KB depending on the screen size and connection, it
was a huge eye opener. It means that people even on the slowest connections are able to access our sites in the quickest of times.
This is incredible considering how in modern front-end development our data sizes have become huge!!

## So, if I had to recommend Gatsby to another person in just one reason?

It is fast...man. Really fast!
